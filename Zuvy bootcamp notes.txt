we can add files in to ways 
1 relative path <the whole path>
2 absolut file <only the path>

BASIC CSS
how to add css in your file 
inline- style atribute
internal- using style tage
external-using css file 
by using link tag 
rel= relation
href=location(hypertext reference)
# == pam selector 
if you are using two images and in that  you are 
using alts image 1 and 2 but you can only use 
alt also 
to give size to the font we should use px, rem, em;
rem is relative to root element 
am is related to parent element 
whaever comes in top it becomes root element 
while writing font-family we should write a 
backup font incase if the first font didnt 
work then the other one will load 
the gap between content and border is called 
padding 
 the gap between border and out side area is 
called margine        

1st specific element is element selector
2nd is class 
3rd atrubute seselectorlector
4th  

if you will use important key word then it will 
give the first preference to the importance

id takes much preference than class 
agar dono hi class hi hai then first priority will take 
niche vala class 

first preference inline css ko hoti hai 
then internal and then extarnal 

desendant selector needs one space btn grandperents and 
grandchild just need one space 

postion me jo values rehti hai vo by default static hi rehta hai 

fixed dhit hota hai nahi hile ga 
sticky parent se chipka rahega

p tag starts on new line
 but span element starts on the same line 
in p element width and height doesnt work 
and on p tag it works 

display is default value 

float propery = allows us to wrap text around 
always put value same as float of clear 

 justify use to take all the plase of the content
